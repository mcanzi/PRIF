We've learnt plenty so far, now let's try to apply it to new, undiscovered data sets. Let's do what data visualisation was made for: exploring and summarising data. For each of the following datasets, please create one ggplot object. We will comment these together if there's time. 

--- 

```{r}
data1 <- swiss
```

---

```{r}
data2 <- nhtemp
```

---

```{r}
data3 <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)  
```
